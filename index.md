# About Me

I'm pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas Since 2017. Before I came here, I was majoring in Information Technology at the Zhejiang Institute of Communications in China. In total, I have experienced professional software developing with more than 6 years in the Computer Science field.

When I was in the Zhejiang Institute of Communications from 2012 to 2015, I was focusing on the front end developing and physical network construction, and therefore, I have a good understanding of web development. 

While I'm studying in the University of Texas at Dallas from 2017, I've focused on software development for 3 years, and thus, I have a strong understanding of both data structures and algorithm analyzing/developing.
